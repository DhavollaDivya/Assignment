The "git fetch"command:

The "git fetch" command is used to pull the updates from remote-tracking branches. 
Additionally, we can get the updates that have been pushed to our remote branches 
to our local machines. As we know, a branch is a variation of our repositories main code, 
so the remote-tracking branches are branches that have been set up to pull and push from remote repository.

Hash Command:

To search for a hash, just enter at least the first 7 characters in the search box. 
Then on the results page, click the "Commits" tab to see matching commits
(but only on the default branch, usually master), or the "Issues" tab to see pull requests containing the commit.

Pull Requests:

A pull request is a method of submitting contributions to an open development project. 
It is often the preferred way of submitting contributions to a project using a distributed 
version control system (DVCS) such as Git.

Git Stash:

The git stash command shelves changes you have made to your working copy 
so you can do another work, and then come back and re-apply them.

Tortoise Git:

TortoiseGit provides git-svn interoperability. You can fetch partial or 
whole history from an SVN remote and store as a local git repository. 
This allows you to browse the history and create commits locally. 
You can finally commit your changes to an SVN remote. Switch/Checkout. 
Updates all files in the working tree to a specific version.
